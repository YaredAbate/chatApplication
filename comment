Final Feedback:
Although , there are other ways to design the classes , this is what I expect you when you design your classes:
1.
Create Interface or Abstract class ---Chat
Add abstract methods: public void write(String message)
                    : public List<String> read(String url)
					: public void display(List messages)
					: Add any other methods if you have more
2.					
Extend or implement Chat ---> create PublicChat	class		

3.
Extend PublicChat or implement Chat       --->  create PrivateChat class
 
4. Add Class Friend.
   Add method: addFriend()
             : updateFriend()
			 : deleteFriend()
			 
5. You normally have two classes for SystemExceptionHandler and CustomExceptionHandler. I expect these classes to inherit one of Exception exption classes.  So , you shouldnt extend one of these
in your Class but create instances of them and write your logs.

@Yared, 
This code has no exception and system logger: No body has collaborated with you.Please inform that person who was assigned to work with your code to add these sections. 

Add Comments in your codes. in each classes add something like these :

What is Javadoc?

Javadoc is a tool which comes with JDK and it is used for generating Java code documentation in HTML format from Java source code, which requires documentation in a predefined format.

Following is a simple example where the lines inside /*â€¦.*/ are Java multi-line comments. Similarly, the line which preceeds // is Java single-line comment.


Example:

/**
* The HelloWorld program implements an application that
* simply displays "Hello World!" to the standard output.
*
* @author  Addisu Thomas
* @version 1.0
* @since   2023-01-01 
*/
public class HelloWorld {

   public static void main(String[] args) {
      // Prints Hello, World! on standard output.
      System.out.println("Hello World!");
   }
}
